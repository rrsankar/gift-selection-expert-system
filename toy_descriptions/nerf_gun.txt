Hasbro Nerf Elite 2.0 Flipshots Flip-8 Blaster with 8 Dart Barrels That Flip to Double Your Firepower, 8-Dart Capacity, 8 Official Nerf Elite Darts, F2549

Flip into battle with the Nerf Elite 2.0 Flipshots Flip-8 blaster! The blaster features 8 barrels -- 4 face forward and 4 face backward. Fire darts from the 4 front-facing barrels, then flip the 4 rear barrels forward to keep on blasting darts. Just when your opponents think youâ€™re out, you can take them by surprise with 4 more fully-loaded barrels! The back-to-back barrels are connected, making it quick and easy to rotate them by pulling back the sight. The sight on top of the blaster doubles as the flip mechanism; pull it back to pivot the barrels. Each barrel holds 1 dart, giving the blaster an 8-dart capacity. Pull down the handle to prime the blaster, and press the trigger to fire 1 dart. Includes 8 Official Nerf Elite 2.0 foam darts. Eyewear recommended (not included). Hand-powered by you (no batteries required). Nerf and all related properties are trademarks of Hasbro.
